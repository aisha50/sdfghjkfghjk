            <p>
                Hosseini family decided to seek political asylum in the United States instead of returning to
                Kabul.
                They moved
                to San Jose, California, where Hosseini graduated from high school. He attended Santa Clara
                University and
                earned a degree in biology.

            <p>
                After college, Hosseini decided to become a physician. He attended the University of
                California-San
                Diego's
                School of Medicine, where he completed his M.D. in 1993. He served his medical residency at the

                for
                television
                and "Pir-e-Kamil."
            </p>
            <p>In 1982, Coelho published his first book, Hell Archives, which failed to make a substantial
                impact.In
                1986 he
                contributed to the Practical Manual of Vampirism, although he later tried to take it off the
                shelves
                since he
                considered it "of bad quality." After making the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1986,
                Coelho wrote The
                Pilgrimage that was published in the year 1987. The following year, Coelho wrote The Alchemist
                and
                published it
                through a small Brazilian publishing house who made an initial print run of 900 copies and
                decided
                not to
                reprint.

            <h2>Paulo Coelho </h2>
            <p>
                Paulo Coelho was born in Brazil and attended a Jesuit school. As a teenager, Coelho wanted to
                become
                a writer.
                Upon telling his mother this, she responded, "My dear, your father is an engineer. He's a
                logical,
                reasonable
                man with a very clear vision of the world. Do you actually know what it means to be a writer?"
                At
                17, Coelho's
                introversion and opposition to following a traditional path led to his parents ting
            </p>
            <p>
                Born into a Catholic family, his parents were strict about the religion and faith. Coelho later
                remarked that
                "It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know what to do... They did not do that
                to
                destroy me,
                they did that to save me." At his parents' wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned
                his
                dream of
                becoming a writer.
