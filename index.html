            <p> A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the
                basic
                facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life
                events.
                Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae résumé, a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting
                various
                aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the
                subject's personality.</p>

            <p> Biographical works are usually non-fiction, but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. One
                in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. Works in diverse media, from literature
                to
                film, form the genre known as biography.</p>
